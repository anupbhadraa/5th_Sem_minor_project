                <p>The event page will have a straightforward design. The schedule, the event location, and the speakers' names and photographs with links will all be in the header section. A section describing the event's goal, including who the event is for and whose audience group it is intended to reach, must also be included.</p>

                <p>Then you can include the person's biography, accomplishments, and a picture of the honoree. You're more than welcome to add some encouraging remarks to your letter as well.

                <h3>Survey Form</h3>
                <p>A survey form is simple to create. To develop forms, you must become familiar with the basic HTML tags and input fields. Then, using the tags, you can create a text field, checkbox, radio button, date, and other essential form elements. CSS can be used once more to improve the look and feel of your form and webpage.</p>
